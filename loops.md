# Fun with loops and Arrays

In our daily job, we use two essential data structure in JS: [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) and [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

## Objects

- keys, values
- reduce to transform into array

## Arrays

### The triforce:

- map
- filter
- reduce

### Arrays and promises (Promise.all)
